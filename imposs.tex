\section{Introduction}
One of the most important themes in the history of the philosophy of science,
initiated by David Hume, has been the difficulty of inductive reasoning,
i.e., how are we able to infer facts from observations.
Karl Popper's ``solution'' to this problem
is that the scientific method is really about trying to find evidence
  {\em against} a hypothesis, and when such evidence cannot be found, despite our best
efforts, this can be regarded as strong evidence {\em for} the hypothesis.
Popper's resolution was, and remains, quite influential.

However, this debate has not ceased since Popper's contribution.
Other key contributions were made by Kuhn, and xx,
but there is still no universally accepted resolution.

However, more pragmatically, this question is also addressed by
statistics. Furthermore, statistics has quantitative procedures.

Even so, statistics also has some really difficult foundational issues
that are not just theoretical. Fundamentally, statistical reasoning relies
on assumptions, just like deductive reasoning. In particular, we have
to adopt a model. Naive practitioners (and that is the vast majority,
esp given that most of them are not actually educated in statistics),
like to believe that it is satisfactory to pick a standard statistical
method and apply it. This is, after all, what they are taught to do. In
fact, not behaving this way is regarded by most users of statistics as
unorthodox, and unsound.

So, statistics is really the modern form of inductive reasoning, and
it is certainly a lot better defined than the philosophical concept of
inductive reasoning.

But, what about deductive reasoning?

The "default" viewpoint is that we only use this in mathematics,
or perhaps for going from one set of assumptions to another. But
cybersecurity, and especially public key cryptography, and also
block-chain techniques, seem to suggest that we can effectively use
deductive reasoning about the real world.

In cybersecurity, the essential problem is to prove that something is
impossible. (You could call it "the impossible dream", i.e. not dreaming
about achieving something impossible, but rather dreaming that we can make
something not wanted impossible). This is, in general, difficult. However,
here is a simple example of how deductive reasoning can easily achieve it.

Suppose I ask you to draw a right-angle triangle, on a flat surface, with
sides of length 3, 4, and 6. (Yes: 6). The right answer to such a request
is to say: "No, I can't do that. It is impossible.". You can show this
by deductive reasoning. But the statement is about a real-world event:
drawing a triangle. This has nothing to do with the precision of the
measurements. The inaccuracy can be quantified. Even an approximately
3,4,6 right-triangle is impossible. There are events, even with
approximate measurements, which can be proved to be impossible. Granted,
the impossibility of non-pythagorean triangles doesn't seem to help a
lot in cybersecurity, but what if we can entangle real world events in
mathematically precise statements in such a way that the events themselves
become impossible?

We can do this, and already do it, using similar reasoning to the above,
and in this way we are able to conclude that certain cybersecurity events can't happen: for
example, this happens when certificates are used, and digital
signatures. Conventional wisdom, from the background of science,
statistics, and experimental methods, strongly suggests that certainty
of this sort is impossible. But the triangle shows that the problem is
not with deducing impossibility. Deducing impossibility is possible! What
is not clear is whether we can systematically employ such deductions for useful
cybersecurity purposes, like preventing servers ferom being hacked.

In fact, we are already doing this, and there will be a lot more such 
deductions in the near future.

\section{Problem Statement}

Many problems in cybersecurity can be expressed as the requirement that certain
events, or outcomes, should be {\em impossible}. 
For example, it is often an objective of an organisation with clients (or
customers), that client data is not accessible except when used for the purpose
of clients. In brief, invalid access to client data should be {\em impossible}.

The problem we tackle in this paper is:
\begin{quote}\em
	How can we systematically, and rigorously, ensure, that 
	certain outcomes are impossible?
\end{quote}


\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{The Importance of Security Policies}
According to \cite{glasgow1992logic} the security reasoning can be needed according to the needed security environment. 
Not all organisations have developed their own version of security policies \cite{paananen2020state}. More research 
still needed to distinguish what could be a good security policies.The measure of what could be a good security policies 
should be state clearly.

\subsection{Policies Development}
Policies development it has to be efficient for the orgnisation security requirements. The security requirements should 
be reflected in the designed security policies.

\section{Examples}

\subsection{Certificate Validation}

\subsubsection{Objectives}
The objectives of a system for validating certificates are:
\begin{enumerate}[CO-1]
\item The system reports as valid, certificates that are valid;
\item The system reports as invalid, certificates that are invalid;
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Validation by Testing}

\subsubsection{Validation by Testing of Logically Constrained Software}

\subsubsection{Impossibility of Certificate Fraud}

\subsection{Access to Client Data}
The objectives of a system for controlling access to client data are:
\begin{enumerate}[DO-1]
\item The system allows clients to update their own data;
\item The system prevents anyone except the client themselves from updating their data.
\end{enumerate}
