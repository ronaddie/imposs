\section{Introduction}
One of the most important themes in the history of the philosophy of science,
initiated by David Hume, has been the difficulty of inductive reasoning,
i.e., how are we able to infer facts from observations.
Karl Popper's ``solution'' to this problem
is that the scientific method is really about trying to find evidence
  {\em against} a hypothesis, and when such evidence cannot be found, despite our best
efforts, this can be regarded as strong evidence {\em for} the hypothesis.
Popper's resolution was, and remains, quite influential.

However, this debate has not ceased since Popper's contribution.
Other key contributions were made by Kuhn, and xx,
but there is still no universally accepted resolution.

However, more pragmatically, this question is also addressed by
statistics. Furthermore, statistics has quantitative procedures.

Even so, statistics also has some really difficult foundational issues
that are not just theoretical. Fundamentally, statistical reasoning relies
on assumptions, just like deductive reasoning. In particular, we have
to adopt a model. Naive practitioners (and that is the vast majority,
esp given that most of them are not actually educated in statistics),
like to believe that it is satisfactory to pick a standard statistical
method and apply it. This is, after all, what they are taught to do. In
fact, not behaving this way is regarded by most users of statistics as
unorthodox, and unsound.

So, statistics is really the modern form of inductive reasoning, and
it is certainly a lot better defined than the philosophical concept of
inductive reasoning.

But, what about deductive reasoning?

The "default" viewpoint is that we only use this in mathematics,
or perhaps for going from one set of assumptions to another. But
cybersecurity, and especially public key cryptography, and also
block-chain techniques, seem to suggest that we can effectively use
deductive reasoning about the real world.

In cybersecurity, the essential problem is to prove that something is
impossible. (You could call it "the impossible dream", i.e. not dreaming
about achieving something impossible, but rather dreaming that we can make
something not wanted impossible). This is, in general, difficult. However,
here is a simple example of how deductive reasoning can easily achieve it.

Suppose I ask you to draw a right-angle triangle, on a flat surface, with
sides of length 3, 4, and 6. (Yes: 6). The right answer to such a request
is to say: "No, I can't do that. It is impossible.". You can show this
by deductive reasoning. But the statement is about a real-world event:
drawing a triangle. This has nothing to do with the precision of the
measurements. The inaccuracy can be quantified. Even an approximately
3,4,6 right-triangle is impossible. There are events, even with
approximate measurements, which can be proved to be impossible. Granted,
the impossibility of non-pythagorean triangles doesn't seem to help a
lot in cybersecurity, but what if we can entangle real world events in
mathematically precise statements in such a way that the events themselves
become impossible?

We can, and already do this, using similar reasoning to the above,
concluding that certain cybersecurity events can't happen: this
is what is happening when certificates are used, and digital
signatures. Conventional wisdom, from the background of science,
statistics, and experimental methods, strongly suggests that certainty
of this sort is impossible. But the triangle shows that the problem is
not with deducing impossibility. Deducing impossibility is possible! But
can we employ such deductions?

I think we are already doing so, and there will be a lot more such deductions in the near future.



May all your publication endeavors be successful.

\section{Problem Statement}
Following Cybersecurity deducted standard will not provide high level
of the assumed security level without the suitable policies.

Subsection text here.



\section{Literature Review}
According to \cite{glasgow1992logic} the security reasoning can be needed according to the needed security environment. 
Not all organisations have developed their own version of security policies \cite{paananen2020state}. More research 
still needed to distinguish what could be a good security policies.The measure of what could be a good security policies 
should be state clearly.
