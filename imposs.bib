               The paper emphasises from the start the political/military meaning
               of the term "security", meaning control of access to sensitive information.
               For this reason, the logic proposed includes, and indeed emphasises modal operators
               which represent knowledge.
               
               In the introduction, the authors introduce as a key focus the concept of
               "security policies".
               
               The introduction then summarises the paper.

               3. Knowledge and Time
               
               3.1 A Logic of Knowledge
               
               3.2 Knowledge and Time
               
               4. Permissions and Obligations
               
               4.1 Introduction to Security Logic
               
               4.2 Axioms for Security Logic
               
               THEOREM.  The theorem that axioms SLl through SL5 are sound with respect is 
               any to our semantics.
               
               ["Soundness" is not defined. If it was, we would need to face the issue
               of whether soundness is a property of the language, or the axioms. In the
               statement of this theorem, it is referred to as a property of the axioms.
               This seems to be a mistake (imho).
               
               The way the term "soundness" is used seems to imply that the term "soundness"
               is taken to mean that these axioms must be true, given the chosen semantics.
               
               This is not the same as the "classical" meaning of soundness, which is:
               
               T |- S => T |= S . 
               
               It seems that the authors are interpreting soundness to mean
               
               T |= S => T |- S . ]
               
               Policy instance. Where I would expect to find a frame of some sort
               we find, instead, "policy instance". The definition, in 5.2, appears
               to be more like "model" than a frame.
               
               5. Defining and Combining Security Policies
               
               5.1 Defining a Security Policy
               
               5.2 Defining a Security Policy Instance
               
               5.3 Combining Policies and Connecting Systems
               
               Compatibility seems to be similar to coherence. It is defined in the context
               of secrecy/security.
               
               6. Examples
               
               The examples, in this section, apply the methodology to rigorously analyse
               several complex and interesting exmples.
               
               6.1 An Information Flow Instance of Multilevel Secrecy
               
               Theorem 1.
               
               6.2 Syntactic Reasoning
               
               6.3 A policy for Integrity
               
               Theorem 2.
               
               6.4 An Access Control Instance of Multilevel Secrecy
               
               Theorem 3.
               
               Theorem 4.
               
               6,5 A Database Access Control Policy
               
               Theorem 5.
               
               7. Discussion
               
               In the concluding remarks, the authors address the interesting question of
               why they use modal logic when first order logic should also be sufficient.
               The answer they give is probably not as full as it should be, but makes
               the main point correctly: "The advantage of using the possible-worlds
               approach is that we can specify abstract properties of security, without
               considering the details of an implementation of a policy."
               
               Imho, a more correct answer is to say that by using modal logic, it becomes
               possible to express policies rigorously, and also in a form fairly
               compatible with the natural language of the devices themselves.},
