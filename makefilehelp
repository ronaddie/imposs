The command newsguide, or newpaper, sets up an environment of creating
and developing latex documents, either a paper or a study guide. A
paper can be regarded as a suitable starting point for any latex document.

This "environment" is made up of:
1. An alias in your .bash_aliases file. the alias will have the name
of the name of the main file under maintenance, prefixed by the letter "w",
in the present case its wimposs.
This alias has the effect of
(a) switching to the working directory for this project, and
(b) sourcing the alias file in this directory (the file called "al")

2. An alias file in the working directory. The aliases include
commands for editing the files in the project, remaking the dvi file,
viewing the dvi file, and so on. The alias "sa" can be used for showing the
alias file.

3. A makefile. This is the most important feature of the editing environment.
The makefile understands how to do the most important operations, such
as exporting (which it takes to be equivalent to copying the source
and generated files to a directory called www), making a dvi file,
making a postscript file, making an html file, and so on.

4. If you are starting from scratch, the newsguide or newpaper
commands will place a template for a study guide or paper in the
working directory.

Note: as the project expands you will naturally want to add more and
more source code files to it. The LaTeX source code files should be
added to the variable TEXFILES in the makefile. BiBTeX files should be
added to the BIBFILES = line, and so on. You can define your own
variables which include lists of files which are part of the project,
and if this variable is included on the right hand side of the EXPORTFILES =
line, these files will be exported along with other files. These "FILES"
lines will be preserved even if the makefile is regenerated by
using the newpaper (or newsguide) command a second time. All the FILES
lines should be kept together however.
